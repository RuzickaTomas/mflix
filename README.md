# Mflix 17

This project serves as a template for anyone following Java course of MongoDB university.
I want to share this updated project, because I wanted to use latest java, but example project was
build by Java 1.8.

Prerequisities:
* Java 17
* Maven 3.8.5 (or newer)
* MongoDB connection string 

Other settings are still the same, for more information please see
